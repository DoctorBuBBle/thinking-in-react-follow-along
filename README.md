# thinking-in-react-follow-along
I created this reprository to build the project from the reactjs docs [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html).

You can find the live demo [here](https://thinking-in-react-follow-along.netlify.app/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `netlify dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `netlify build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
